    Ensures there's always only one entry in the database, and can fix the
    table (by deleting extra entries) even if added via another mechanism.

    Also has a static load() method which always returns the object - from
    the database if possible, or a new empty (default) instance if the
    database is still empty. If your instance has sane defaults (recommended),
    you can use it immediately without worrying if it was saved to the
    database or not.

    Useful for things like system-wide user-editable settings.
