# Installation instructions
## Requirements
OHAI-kit requires the following dependencies :

* Django >= 1.7
 * Python
* easy_thumbnails
* django_markdown
* __*Optional*__ :  Apache
 * mod_wsgi

### Django
OHAI-kit depends on Django version 1.7 or latest. 

Django will be automatically installed by ohai-kit's setup script, so it is not necessary to install it yourself. If you wish to install Django manually, keep reading.

In order to install Django, please refer to the [Django installation tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/)

Make sure you have installed Python and PyPi (python-pip) from your distribution's package manager, then run :
`sudo pip install django`

Once installed, run the command :

`python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"`

And make sure that the django version is at least 1.7.

### easy_thumbnails
Easy_thumbnails will be automatically installed by ohai-kit's setup script. However, to manually install it, use the command :

`sudo pip install easy_thumbnails`

### django_markdown
OHAI-kit requires the django_markdown package installed.
The django_markdown is a replacement for the previously deprecated django.contrib.markup package.
Django_markdown will be automatically installed by ohai-kit's setup script. However, to manually install it, use the command :

`sudo pip install django_markdown`

### Installing ohai-kit
To install ohai-kit and all its required dependencies, simply run :

`sudo python setup.py install`

The setup script will install ohai-kit then it will look for its dependency packages and install them.

# Configuring the Django project
OHAI-kit is a django application. You will first need to create a django project
in which to use the ohai_kit application. 

## Creating a project
Start by creating a django project with the command :

`django-admin startproject myproject`

Where 'myproject' can be any name you want to give the project.

This will create a _myproject_ directory containing a few files to represent your project. Change your current working directory to the _myproject_ directory. The _manage.py_ script will be used to manage the project, and the 'myproject' subdirectory will contain your project's settings and configurations.

## Setting up the project
Edit the **_myproject/settings.py_** file, and add to the *INSTALLED_APPS* variable, the *django_markdown*, *easy_thumbnails* and *ohai_kit* apps, such that the variable looks like this :
```
  INSTALLED_APPS = (
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'django_markdown',
      'easy_thumbnails',
      'ohai_kit',
  )
```

## Configuring the database
You can also configure the database to use in the **_myproject/settings.py_** file. By default, the django project will use a sqllite3 database in the local file **db.sqlite3** in the project's base directory.
Refer to the [Django database documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#databases) for information on how to set-up your database.
You can either leave it as the default :
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
```
Or set it up to use a PostgreSQL, Oracle or MySQL database for example :
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
``` 

Once the database is configured, you must then create the database by running the command :

`python manage.py migrate`

If you update OHAI-kit or install other applications to your Django project or modify anything relating to the database, you must again call the migrate command.

## Configuring static file deployment
Your django settings will have a **STATIC_URL** option set by default to `/static/`. You can change that value to modify the URL for static file deployments.
You will also need to add the full absolute path where you will want to serve your static files on the server using the **STATIC_ROOT** variable.

For example :
```
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = '/var/www/myproject/static/'
```

## Configuring media uploads
In order to allow uploads of media to the ohai-kit server, you will need to configure a couple of additional options in **myproject/settings.py**. If you do not properly configure the media uploads, then you may not be able to upload pictures for your assembly instructions.

You will need to add the **MEDIA_URL** and **MEDIA_ROOT** variables to the _settings.py_ file where **MEDIA_URL** will be the URL of your media files and **MEDIA_ROOT** will be the _absolute path_ of your media directory.

For example :
```
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = '/var/www/myproject/media/'
```

## Configuring the URLs
You can now add a URL to the project that would resolve to the `ohai_kit` application by editing the **myproject/urls.py** file and adding a _url_ line to it.
Refer to the [Django URL functions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/urls/) for more information.

Please note however that Ohai-kit does not currently support being installed as a subdirectory such as '^ohai/'. You must set the URL for ohai-kit as the root directory of your website. This can be achieved by adding the following line to **myproject/urls.py** :

` url(r'^', include('ohai_kit.urls', namespace='ohai_kit')),`

You should end up with a **myproject/urls.py** containing something similar to this :
```
from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
    url(r'^', include('ohai_kit.urls', namespace='ohai_kit')),
)
```


## Creating administrator user
Before you can start using Ohai-kit, you must first create the administrator user by running the following command :

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

Then follow the instructions on screen to create the administrator user for the application.

## Running OHAI-kit
Now that the django project is created and configured, you can test it by running the command : 

`python manage.py runserver`

This will run a local http server on port 8000 and print the address of the server, which will be by default **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**.
You can then enter that URL in your browser to test the server, and specify the URL you used in **myproject/urls.py** (by default _'admin/'_) to access the admin page or OHAI-kit.

You can run the server on any ip:port you want and use it on your production server. For more information on the available options, you can run :

`python manage.py help runserver`

Before using ohai-kit on a production server, make sure to set the **DEBUG** variable to *False* in the **settings.py** file.
It might be more secure however to use Apache on a production server.

# Configuring Apache
You can run OHAI-Kit from Apache using the *mod_wsgi* module. You can read the instructions for deploying Django projects using Apache and mod_wsgi from the relevent [Django documentation page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/).
Remember however that Ohai-kit does not currently support being installed as part of an existing host under a subdirectory. You must install ohai-kit as its own virtual host configured to match the url `'^'`.

In order to integrate Ohai-kit with Apache, you will need the mod_wsgi module loaded and configured and to configure static file deployments and media file access.

The following instructions are for Apache 2.4 and later.
We recommend you create a ohai_kit.conf file in your /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory.

For ohai-kit running as your main server's application, and your django project named 'myproject', your Apache ohai_kit.conf file would look like this :
```
Alias /static/ /var/www/myproject/static/
Alias /media/ /var/www/myproject/media/

<Directory /var/www/myproject/static>
Require all granted
</Directory>

<Directory /var/www/myproject/media>
Require all granted
</Directory>

WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/myproject/myproject/wsgi.py
WSGIPythonPath /var/www/myproject

<Directory /var/www/myproject/myproject>
<Files wsgi.py>
Require all granted
</Files>
</Directory>
```

You will then need to create a **media** directory in your django project's base directory and copy the static files into the **static** directory using the **collectstatic** command.
```
mkdir /var/www/myproject/media
python manage.py collectstatic
```
The **collectstatic** command of the *manage.py* file will copy all the required static files in the appropriate directories according to your **STATIC_URL** and **STATIC_ROOT** variables defined in the *myproject/settings.py* file.

You must then make sure that the project directory has the proper permissions for access from Apache otherwise the database will be inaccessible.

```chown apache:apache -R /var/www/myproject```

If you are using ohai-kit on a production server, make sure to set the **DEBUG** variable to *False* in the **settings.py** file.
